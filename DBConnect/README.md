# Overview
Learning how to work with SQL Relational Databases was not as narrow as it might at first seem. When learning a new language, if you already have experience with other programming languages and Integrated Development Environments the focus is on the way the syntax varies and not so much on what the language is doing or the environment you are using to develop a program. For understanding databases I first needed to understand where a database is and how to create a new one. I moved on to working with the database using SQL commands where the database was stored (SQL Workbench). I then needed to learn how to work with the database using an IDE. I wrote a program to keep track of some books I would like to read. The data contained the title of the book, the author, and the number of pages. I used Visual Studio Code to create the database and add some books to it. 

I've heard the word databases many times, but as my focus was initially on learning programming and learning different programming languages I didn't think much about databases. I decided on the SQL Realational Database module because I didn't know anything about databases, how they work, or how to interact with them. I want my knowledge of technology to be broad while striving for depth in those subjects I am most passionate about. Understanding databases allows me to be a better software engineer by giving me a deeper knowledge of the best ways to store data for specific programs.

# Relational Database
I am using MySQL to create a database of books I would like to read. I use three columns to keep track of the title of the book, the author, and the number of pages in each book. I created a simple program using Visual Studio Code that has a main menu of options for adding books to the database, deleting books from the database, and displaying the current books that are in the database. 

# Development Environment
I used MySQL as my database. I used Visual Studio Code for creating the database, adding books, deleting books, and modifying any of the information I might have needed to change.

# Future Work
* Even though I know how to use the commands I don't feel like I really know them yet. I would like to be more solid with using mySQL.
* I need to work more on using mySQL workbench and query for manipulating the data in the databases I created.
